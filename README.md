## Info
* The drifting bottle website provides a new form of communication: randomness. It is fate that brings some users together in one drifting bottle, as a user will only see 2-4 random bottles at one time and decide whether to pick up and respond or not. There is no need to worry about information overload or social anxiety. Users can only follow the bottles they created or responded to on the profile page, rather than people who leave messages in the bottles. Let's keep the focus on the conversation rather than the people who are communicating with you. Express your ideas freely without concern about socializing!
* When getting lost in web navigation, why not asking help from Bukabuka? Click on Bukabuka, and then he will highlight a UI button and explain its function to you. All the buttons are covered in his tour guidance.
